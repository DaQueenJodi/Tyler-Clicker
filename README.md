# Tyler-Clicker
A shitty clicker game made in SDL2 for PC (and eventually switch)

TODO:

- [X] Add shop 
- [X] Add easy way to add buttons/shop items
- [ ] Add shop menu (and obviously a shop button). this may not be neccasary, so may not ever come
- [ ] Add add an Idle component. preferably in an okay way. I have something planned but its likely hot garbage so i'd like to think more about it before adding it.


- [ ] Port it to the switch! This will involve a few changes, mostly the way files will be stored, but will be relatively simple
