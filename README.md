# Tyler-Clicker
A shitty clicker game made in SDL2 for PC (and eventually switch)

TODO:

[X] Add shop
[X] Add easy way to add buttons/shop items
[ ] Add shop menu
[ ] Add add an Idle component. preferably in an okay way. I have something planned but its likely hot garbage so i'd like to think more about it before adding it.


[ ] Port it to the switch! This will involve a few changes, mostly the way files will be stored, but will be relatively simple
